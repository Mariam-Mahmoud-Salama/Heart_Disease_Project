#  Heart Disease Prediction Project  

A machine learning project to predict heart disease using multiple classification models, dimensionality reduction, feature selection, clustering, and model deployment.  
This project applies **supervised and unsupervised learning** techniques to the UCI Heart Disease dataset and demonstrates a full ML pipeline from preprocessing to deployment.

# Dataset
The dataset comes from the UCI Heart Disease Repository

# Models
Supervised Learning (Classification)

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree

Random Forest

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Metrics:

Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score

ROC Curve & AUC

ðŸ”¹ Unsupervised Learning (Clustering)

K-Means (with Elbow method)

Hierarchical Clustering (dendrograms)

DBSCAN

Silhouette Analysis

ðŸ”¹ Dimensionality Reduction

Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

ðŸ”¹ Feature Selection

Feature importance and correlation analysis

ðŸ”¹ Hyperparameter Tuning
